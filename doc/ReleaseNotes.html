		<h1>Version 1.13</h1>
		<h3>HTTPS Support</h3>
		<p>	Sometime prior to July 2017, changes were made to the USGS webserver that force the use of an encrypted HTTPS connection
			in place of HTTP to download the SRTM tiles. Version 1.13 adds support for HTTPS using Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2. 
			The USGS server does not seem to accept earlier versions of TLS. </p>
		<h3>Java Version</h3>
		<p>	Previous versions of TerrainTool were built using Java 6 because this was the highest version supported on Mac OS X at the time (2010). However,
			Java 6 does not support TLS1.2, forcing TerrainTool 1.13 to be built on Java 7. Oracle provide downloads for both Java 7 and 
			Java 8 for OS X but be aware that there may be compatibility issues with legacy Mac systems.<b>I'm keen to hear from Mac users 
			about whether their systems support Java 7 or Java 8 because it would clearly be better for everyone if I could upgrade TerrainTool 
			to be build on the latest and most secure version of Java.</b></p>
        <h1>Version 1.12a</h1>
        <h3>ASTER 2</h3>
        <p>This version bring support for the ASTER-2 dataset that has recently become available. This 
            has the same resolution as the original ASTER data but the processing has resulted in fewer artefacts. Internally,
            the data format is the same as before but the filename e.g. ASTGTM2_N51W003.zip now includes a "2" to indicate that it 
            is from the ASTER-2 dataset. Note: you can't just read the file and read it as though it came from the original 
            ASTER dataset because the files inside the outer zip "wrapper" also have a "2" added to their names.</p>
        <h3>File Locations</h3>
        <p>Previous versions of TerrainTool running under Windows placed the terraintool.properties and data directory 
            in the same directory as terraintool.jar. Under unix-family operating systems, (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian) these
            files were created in the current working directory, wherever that happened to be. If the current directory 
            already contained a sub-directory called "data", terrain data files were just added to it. This sometimes resulted 
            in terrain data being added to unrelated data directories and, potentially, duplication of data.</p>
        <p>
            The sections below explain where the data files and properties file will be located, according to whether you
            have the cross-platform version (default) or used an application installer under Ubuntu or Debian. If you already have
            data that has been downloaded from the SRTM or ASTER sites, you may want to copy these into the new data directory to 
            avoid having to download them again.
        </p>
        <h4>Cross-platform version</h4>
        <p>
            If you downloaded TerrainTool as a "jar" file from the UBSS web site, you have the cross-platform version which is 
            built to run under Windows, Unix family (Ubuntu, Debian, Solaris etc.) and OS X.
            By default, this version of TerrainTool creates the terraintool.properties and the data store in the 
            .terraintool sub-directory of the user's home directory. For recent Windows versions, this would be something 
            like c:\users\Mike\.terraintool or /home/mike/.terraintool on Ubuntu. Note that normally, Unix-family operating 
            systems treat directories starting with "." as hidden - hence the sub-directory may not be visible.
        <h4>Unix-specific Version</h4>
        <p>
            Apart from downloading terraintool.jar from the UBSS web site, TerrainTool can also be installed as a
            pre-packaged application for Ubuntu and Debian (thanks to Wookey!). This is identical to the cross-platform
            version, except that the properties file and data directory are placed in a more unix-friendly location, as follows:-
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set, terraintool.properties goes in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/terraintool/. Otherwise, it goes
            in $HOME/.config/terraintool/ 
            </li>
            <li>
                if $XDG_DATA_HOME is set, the data directory is $XDG_DATA_HOME/terraintool/ Otherwise it is $HOME/.local/share/terraintool/ 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Customisation</h4>
        <p>
            If building TerrainTool from source-code, the file locations are easily customised by changing a single 
            line of TerrainFrame.java and writing a class to implement the Pathnames interface. See Pathnames.java.
